This project is an HRIS-based Workforce Analytics system that analyzes employee data using Employee ID as a unique identifier to generate actionable HR insights. It helps HR teams understand workforce patterns, identify attrition risks, and retrieve complete employee-level details through a lookup feature, simulating a real-world HR Information System.

The system applies data preprocessing, attrition risk classification, and workforce analysis to support data-driven HR decisions. By linking employee attributes such as tenure, job satisfaction, income, and performance, the project demonstrates how HR analytics can improve retention strategies, workforce planning, and organizational effectiveness.
